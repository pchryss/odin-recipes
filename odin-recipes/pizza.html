        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My ultimate comfort food. My entire life I have appreciated
            the comforting feeling of watching tv on the couch while eating
            pizza.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 medium green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. 
                    Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms
                </li>
                <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes.
                    Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let 
                    rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook
                    beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking 
                    meat into crumbles; drain.
                </li>
                <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in
                    pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each 
                    crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.
                </li>
                <li>Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned</li>
            </ol>
