# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be creating a recipe website that contains a home page that will serve as the navigator, and multiple linked webpages that will contain recipes. 

To accomplish this, I will have to incorporate the following techniques
    - Creating an HTML boilerplate
    - Use textual elements such as p and headers to display text
    - Use a elements with href tags to link my main page to several recipes
    - Use img elements with src tags to link photos of the food
    - Use ordered or unordered lists to create recipe instructions
    - And finally, incorporate proper Git conventions into my project
